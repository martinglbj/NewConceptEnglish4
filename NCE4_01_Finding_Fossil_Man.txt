听录音，然后回答以下问题。

Why are legends handed down by storytellers useful?

We can read of things that happened 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where people first learned to write.  
Near East 近东，人类早期文明的发源地，大致包括了美索不达米亚，塞普路斯，古代埃及
，古代伊朗，安那托利亚，黎凡特(Levant 指地中海东部及其岛屿和沿岸的各国希腊，黎巴
嫩等)和阿拉伯半岛地区
介词使用：read [of] things that ... 读到；阅悉；获悉

But there are some parts of the world where even now people cannot write. 
副词使用：there are some parts of the world [where] ... parts对应where，不使用in which
副词使用：[even] now sb. cannot do. 与 sb. [even] cannot do now 相比，强调的重点
不同，前者强调sb. cannot do的状态一直延续“直至现在”（时间），后者强调现在这个timing“sb. 仍然cannot do”（动作）。

The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas -- legends handed down from one generation of story tellers to another.
recount v. 叙述
saga n. 英雄故事。特指中世纪冰岛和挪威的长篇故事
legend n. 传说，传奇
短语：hand down from sb. to sb_2. 留传下来
句型：The only way [that] sb. can do sth. [is to] do sth_2. 前置only way突出目的与途径对应关系的唯一性、重要性。
      这个句式如果连用两个that从句就不优雅了： The only way that sb. can do sth. is that sth_2 to be done.
      这时不如考虑将第一个that从句换成to do： The only way to do sth. is that sth_2. to be done.

These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did.
migration n. 迁移，移居
(Answer in sentence.)
句型：sth. can tell sb. something about histories/stories/migrations of sb_2. who did ... 两次定语从句后置。以story为例，可以把句子变为：
      sth. can tell sb. something about the story that sb_2. did ...
      这里可以看到带指定冠词的“the story”只适合指特定的人物或事件，这里如果用复>数stoies来表达的就应理解为泛指的不定的许多的人物或事件。
      另外the story that .. 从句可表达较复杂的story content，而stories of sb_2. who did ...做定语后置只为了突出stories的人sb_2.

Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from.
anthropologist n. 人类学家
ancestor n. 祖先
Polynesian adj.波利尼西亚（中太平洋之一群岛）的
peoples n. 民族，部落，种族(pl. peoples)
        people做为泛指的人/公民理解时，本身就指persons/citizens(pl.)，若做主语动
词一般为复数变格。但这里不能理解为泛泛的人类。
句型：wonder where the ancestors of sb. [now doing sth.] came from. 从句修饰the ancestors
The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.
Indonesia n. 印度尼西亚

But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten.
句型： lived [so] long ago [that] even their sagas are forfotten. so..that..句型
突出了long ago这个原因

So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first 'modern men' came from.
archaeologist n. 考古学家
句型：have [neither] sth. [nor] sth_2. to do... 既无sth也无sth_2来做，有排比的美感

Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint, because this is easier to shape than other kinds.
flint n. 燧石

They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away.
rot n. 烂掉
介词使用：have rotted [away] 腐烂掉

Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.
句型：sth. does not do, [and so] sth_2. has done. 强调因果，and so之前的句子使用
现在时，表示公理或常识性的事物
